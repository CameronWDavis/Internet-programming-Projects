        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Cameron Davis I am a Computer Science Major who currently works as a cloud developer at Fidelity National Financial. I have worked here for almost a year this year and 
            my work mainly consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure" target="_blank" id="p1">Azure</a>, Infastructure as code, and automating solutions. I am 22 years old and have lived in Jacksonville, Florida my whole life. Which with all the people moving here feels
            kind of rare to be a native Floridian. 
        </p>

        <p>Some interesting facts about me are, I have broken my arm 2 times (the same arm). I played football in high school and my junior year my high school went to states... and lost but still went. 
            I am fluent in two languages, and I have been outside the US 3 times, Bahamas, Brazil, and France </p>

            <h2 id="hobby">Hobbies & Interests</h2>

            <p>My favorite hobbies are surfing, skating, playing with my dog, hiking, and snowboarding. I think riding a board and being with nature in the element of surfing and snowboarding is one of the coolest expirences a human can have.
                I feel so close to nature when I am doing these activities.I also program as a hobby in my freetime it mainly consists of me having a cool idea to build and then finding a new cool 
                idea to build right after and stopping the first idea :(.</p>

                <p> My favorite programming language is C# with the .Net framework, however at work I mainly use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)" target="_blank" id="p1">terraform</a> a which is a cloud infastructure as code solution.
                 Currently I am trying to learn game development as a way to advance my code and create something I would consider artwork that I could have other people play. I also cook alot in my freetime and am working on learning how to cook french food.</p> 
                 <table>
                     <tr>

                         <td><img src="images/hike.jpg" alt="dog" width="350" height="300"></td>

            <h2 id="school">Education</h2>
            
            <p>I started off going to the FSCJ for a degree in accounting. I was working the helpdesk for the port authority during this time period. Eventually after working in IT and attending
                2 acounting classes I realized I wanted to work in IT.I also have 1 azure certification to my name which has allowed me to work my current job as a cloud developer at <a id="p1" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_National_Financial" target="_blank">Fidelity National Title</a>. 
            </p>

                <p>After I transfered from FSCJ to UNF I got into my computing classes and have done a majority of the program. Currently my graduation is set for Fall 2023. Some of my favorite classes 
                    I have taken at UNF are Theory of Computation, discrete math, Data Structures, and Computer Architecture and Organization. </p>
